# Project Requirements and Setup

## Testing and Installation

**Important:** For testing, running and installing anything related to the current feature branch, always use the instructions written in the current `SETUP.md` file.

The `SETUP.md` file (located at `docs/density_matrix_project/SETUP.md`) contains the most up-to-date and accurate instructions for:
- Setting up the development environment
- Installing dependencies
- Building the project
- Running tests
- Troubleshooting common issues

Always refer to `SETUP.md` rather than relying on potentially outdated instructions elsewhere.

## Technical Requirements
