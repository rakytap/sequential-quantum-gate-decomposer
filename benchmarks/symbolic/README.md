# Symbolic gate reference comparisons

`reference_comparison_20261106.json.gz` records one explicit parameter binding
for each of the 327 catalog definitions against all 32 basis presets. It is a
reference dataset for developing the symbolic search, not a report of new
optimal symbolic synthesis results.

The eleven supported Qiskit adapters provide 3,597 matrix-verified numerical
upper bounds. The other 6,867 cells explicitly report `unsupported_sdk_basis`.
Every selected circuit passed verification, every supported comparison had a
valid circuit, and no selected result exceeded an applicable fixed-gate
literature bound in the curated ledger (24 comparisons).

The run uses Qiskit 2.2.3, SymPy 1.14.0, NumPy as recorded in the JSON, and seed
219. Connectivity is all-to-all with zero ancillas. All operations, parameters,
global phases, errors, attempted inputs, source checksums, and compiler failures
are retained. Scalar-phase corrections are explicit operations on the delivered
circuit's global phase; the verifier does not ignore phase differences.
Inputs are arbitrary states, and both input and output wire orders are fixed.
Register structure is retained; virtual output permutations are materialized
through Qiskit's permutation-preserving compilation path and charged.

| Gate | Selected CNOT upper bound |
| --- | ---: |
| Margolus | 3 |
| RCCX | 3 |
| Peres | 5 |
| Toffoli / CCX | 6 |
| Fredkin / CSWAP | 7 |

The original parameter-sensitive score is preserved in the symbolic search.
These numerical compiler outputs do not have that score: SDK parameter-slot
counts are separate diagnostics. A successful sample is not a symbolic proof
for all parameter values. Proved minima and parameter-dependent exact tests
are documented in [the symbolic guide](../../docs/symbolic_decomposition.md)
and the source-backed reference ledger.

Regenerate from the repository root with the symbolic dependencies and Qiskit:

```bash
python examples/decomposition/symbolic_reference_comparison.py \
  --basis all --output /tmp/symbolic-reference-comparison.json
```

The command exits nonzero for a compiler failure or a regression against an
applicable recorded literature count. Interrupted runs retain a `.partial.json`
checkpoint. Source checksums identify the exact implementation used even when
the recorded Git revision was the parent of the commit containing this data.
